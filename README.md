## Research Experience
**Whole-Brain Modelling and Whole-Brain Dynamical Analysis in ALZHEIMERâ€™S DISEASE**
@Centre for Brain and Cognition, Computational Neuroscience Group, 
Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain (_Nov 2024 - June 2025_)

**Supervised by - Prof. Gustavo Deco and Dr. Jakub Vohryzek**
- Applied Hopf bifurcation models and gradient algorithms to derive Generative Effective Connectivity (GEC) from ADNI data.
- Identified novel network biomarkers for early disease stages potentially enabling better diagnosis and monitoring.

  
**Crystallography based investigation of non-covalent interactions to design antidiabetic compounds**
Research Assistant,Lady Brabourne College, Kolkata (_Sept 2022 - July 2023_)

**Supervised by Prof. Nayim Sepay**
- Worked with data of 106 protein-ligand crystal structures of Human Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV by curating from Protein Data Bank and
studying their bonding structure and active residue sites.
- Studied protein-small molecule interactions of DPP-4 aimed at identifying potential inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
